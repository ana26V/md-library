# Book Management Application

This is a book management app that allows users to share their book collections and view other users' books. Users can manage their books by adding, editing, and deleting entries. Each book includes properties such as title, author, description, cover image, and the owner's details.

The app also features a library where all books from users are displayed. Users can search, paginate, and view detailed information about each book. Authentication is required for managing books, and JWT tokens are used for secure login.
